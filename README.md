## Setting up an SSH key between cs50 IDE and Github

#### Configuring your user info

* In your command line, type the following: `git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`
  * Don't copy/paste.
  * Remember to use YOUR email address.
  * YES, you need the quotes.
  * Example: `git config --global user.email "johnd1234@hstat.org"`
* Then type `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
  * Example: `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`

#### Generating and connecting an SSH key
* Make sure you are in the root directory by doing `cd ~`
* `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com"` then slowly press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> repeatedly until you see something like:
```
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|       .o o..    |
|       o +Eo     |
|        + .      |
|         . + o   |
|        S o = * o|
|           . o @.|
|            . = o|
|           . o   |
|            o.   |
+-----------------+
```
* `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` starts the agent in the background
* `ls -al ~/.ssh` you should now see a file named `id_rsa.pub`
* `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` then copy _all_ of the result to your clipboard (it should start with `ssh-rsa` and end with your email address)
* Go to https://github.com/settings/keys > New SSH Key
  * Title: ide50
  * Key: paste your ssh key
  * Press the green **Add SSH key** button
* Back in your cs50 IDE, do `sudo nano ~/.ssh/config`
* Paste the following:
```
Host github.com
 Hostname ssh.github.com
 Port 443
```
* <kbd>control</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to exit, then press <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
* `ssh -T git@github.com`
* Type `yes`, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, and you should see
> Hi "username"! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

## Enabling Preview
* In the top-left corner of the IDE, click **CS50 IDE** > Preferences
* When the new window opens, on the LEFT side, click **User Settings**
* On the RIGHT side, toggle **Enable Preview** to **ON**
* You're done!
  * This means that in the future, you will be able to right-click on a file (i.e. HTML or Markdown) and click **Preview**
  * On a Mac, if you have a mouse with no right-click, hold <kbd>CONTROL</kbd> then click
  * Tip 1: Drag the new tab that appeared to the right side of your IDE _(similar to the image below)_
![](preview-in.png)
  * Tip 2: Use the pop-out icon to preview outside the IDE _(similar to the image below)_

## Enabling Auto-Save
* If you closed the Preferences tab, re-open it: **CS50 IDE** > Preferences
* When the new window opens, on the LEFT side, scroll down and click **Experimental**
* On the RIGHT side, change the **Auto-Save** dropdown to **On Focus Change**
* You're done!
  * This means that in the future, when editing a file, you will be see a red dot in the tab, next to the filename
  * A red dot means there are unsaved changes
  * When you change (i.e. "focus") to a different window (i.e. "preview"), the red dot will turn green, then back to an **X**
* You can also force a save by going to **File** > **Save** or using the keyboard shortcut (i.e. <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>)
